# time-series-custom-reports

A collection of custom reports for AQUARIUS Time-Series.

# Build requirements

- Visual Studio 2019 (Community Edition is fine)
- When building, you will see an evaluation licence dialog from SharpShooter Reports unless you purchase a dedicated license.

A prepackaged *.report bundle will be found in the `src\Reports\deploy\$Configuration` folder (for both `Debug` and `Release` builds)
